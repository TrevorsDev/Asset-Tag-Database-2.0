# Asset-Tag-Database-2.0

This project is a rebuild of my original asset tracking system, designed to reinforce my understanding of full-stack development and improve SQL compatibility with Microsoft SQL Server. I'm currently using **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) for backend development and **React (with Vite)** for the frontend.

The goal is to create a professional, MVP-ready web application that is ready to be adapted or refactored into an enterprise's current tech stack. Most importantly it should allow users to:

- View individual IT assets
- Add, remove, and update assets manually via a frontend form
- Search and filter assets by column (e.g., model, department, status)
- Generate and download reports
- Import assets via CSV (with Upsert logic)
- Authenticate users and restrict access

## ✅ Current Progress

### 🔧 Backend (Supabase)
- Fully implemented assets table with UUID PKs and unique constraints.

- Row‑level security configured.

- Seed data and utility SQL scripts included.

- Upsert logic prepared for CSV imports.

- Database rejects conflicting serial numbers or asset tags to maintain integrity.

### 💻 Frontend (React + Vite)
- Asset table with live Supabase data.

- Asset creation form with validation.

- Centralized filtering system using a single search bar.

- Fully refactored CSVUploader with:

   - Custom CSV parser

   - Header normalization

   - Two‑stage review

   - Strict validation

   - Smart error handling

   - Centralized reset logic

   - Professional file input behavior

### 🎨 UI/UX
- Semantic HTML for accessibility.

- Reusable button styles.

- Reusable ```<Alert />``` component for success/error messaging.

- Clean, consistent layout across components.

### ⚔️ Code Standards
- Semantic HTML: Prioritizes the use of descriptive tags (`<section>`, `<label>`, `<p>`) over generic `<div>` nesting to improve accessibility and SEO.

- **Data Management:** Custom `useAssets` hook manages fetching and bulk data operations.

#### Key Features
#### ✅ CSVUploader Component
The CSVUploader is a fully refactored, production‑ready bulk import tool designed for reliability, clarity, and user‑friendly error handling.

#### 📄 Custom CSV Parsing Engine
Built using the browser’s native FileReader API — no third‑party libraries.

- Handles thousands of rows efficiently.

- Skips blank lines and malformed rows.

- Validates that the CSV contains both headers and data rows.

#### 🧭 Header Normalization Layer
- Automatically maps inconsistent CSV headers (e.g., sn, serial, dept, department) into database‑compliant column names. This allows non‑technical staff to upload files without strict formatting.

#### 🧪 Two‑Stage Review Workflow
- Upload CSV → Preview row count

- Confirm & Upload → Commit to database

- This prevents accidental imports and gives users confidence before writing to the database.

#### 🛡️ Strict Data Integrity Enforcement
- Validates uniqueness of Asset Tags and Serial Numbers.

- Database rejects conflicting rows to prevent corruption.

- Clear messaging explains why a row failed.

#### 🎯 Smart Error Handling
- Local Errors: invalid file type, empty CSV, malformed rows, missing headers.

- Database Errors: constraint violations, duplicates, or Supabase rejections.

- Errors are displayed through a unified ```<Alert />``` component.

#### 🔁 Professional File Input Behavior
The uploader now handles all edge cases cleanly:

- Users can re‑select the same file after Cancel, error, or success.

- File input resets automatically after every action.

- No need to refresh the page to retry an upload.

#### 🧹 Centralized Reset Logic
- All resets (file input, errors, preview, success state) are handled through dedicated helper functions:

   - resetFileInput()

   - clearAllErrors()

   - resetState()

   - This reduces duplication and makes the component easier to maintain.

### 🧠 Architecture & Code Quality Improvements
#### State Management
- All CSVUploader state transitions are now predictable and centralized.

- Error states are separated into local vs external (database) for clarity.

- File input resets are handled consistently across all user actions.

## 🗂️ Selection Mode & Bulk Delete Architecture

The asset table now includes a scalable, enterprise‑ready bulk‑delete system built on centralized state management and clean component boundaries.

### 🔑 Key Architecture

- **Selection state lives in `App.jsx`**  
  `selectedIds` and `isSelectionMode` are now top‑level state, allowing both the table and toolbar to react to selection changes.

- **AssetTable is now a pure UI component**  
  It no longer manages global state or errors. It:
  - Renders rows  
  - Displays checkboxes when selection mode is active  
  - Emits selection events upward  

- **Toolbar is selection‑aware**  
  It receives:
  - `selectedCount`  
  - `isSelectionMode`  
  - `setIsSelectionMode`  
  - `onDeleteSelected`  

  This enables contextual actions like:
  - “Delete X Assets”
  - “Cancel Selection”

- **Bulk delete logic is centralized**  
  `handleBulkDelete()` now lives in `App.jsx` and:
  - Confirms the action  
  - Calls `deleteMultipleAssets()`  
  - Clears selection  
  - Exits selection mode  

### 🧼 Cleanup & Refactor Notes

- Removed legacy column‑filtering system (`FiltersBar`, `ColumnFilter`, and all filter state).
- Removed unused `error` and `setError` props from `AssetTable`.
- Removed local selection state from `AssetTable`.
- Prepared the table for the upcoming **hover‑to‑activate selection mode** and **slide‑in checkbox column**.

## 🔮 Upcoming UX Enhancements (Planned)

- Hover‑activated selection handles on each row  
- Slide‑in checkbox column with smooth animation  
- A contextual action banner between toolbar and table  
- “Delete X Assets” and “Cancel Selection” actions  
- Polished row‑shift animations  

#### UX Enhancements
- Clear success and error alerts using a reusable ```<Alert />``` component.

- “Change File” button appears only when appropriate.

- Cancel button now fully resets the uploader.

- Prevents users from uploading malformed or empty CSVs.

#### Error Safety
- No partial writes.

- No silent failures.

- No corrupted data.

- Users always know what happened and why.
