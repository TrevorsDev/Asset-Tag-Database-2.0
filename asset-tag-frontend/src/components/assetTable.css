/* QUESTIONS FOR AI: 
Im noticing that you are using ".table-wrapper {

    margin-top: 20px;

} " pixels for your dimensions. I want to be using something responsive. As far as i know, that really is the most professional practice. so, what units might you recommend?  



Also, Im in the bay area california. what are some of the BEST tech meetups for someone who is attempting to break into the software development, or IT industry?

After I finish with this project, im a bit concerned on what new project i could work on that would be insightful to learn from, useful, AND impressive to employeers when they view my portfolio. A personal website is probably the best next project. but what other projects should I consider, both software engineering specific & hardware software combinations like a home camera system with its own in-house server are examples I think of.
